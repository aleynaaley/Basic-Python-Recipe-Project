My project in data structures class. I tried using two data structures linked list and tree. We compare the products received from the user and the recipes we keep with the tree data structure. 
After the comparison process, our percentage agreement appears. If all the ingredients are there, it's like 100%. In recipes that do not match 100%, missing ingredients are also kept and printed.
I tried to use the tkinter library in the project I wrote in Python. It is open to development and editable.
