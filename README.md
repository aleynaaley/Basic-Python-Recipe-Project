My project in data structures class. I tried using two data structures linked list and tree. 
I compare the products I receive from the user with the recipes I keep with the tree data structure. 
After the comparison process, our percentage agreement appears. If all the ingredients are there, it's like 100%. In recipes that do not match 100%, missing ingredients are also kept and printed.
I tried to use the tkinter library in the project I wrote in Python. It is open to development and editable.
